It is recommended to first download all of the modules specified in the requirements.txt file in order to run the code.


Description of the folders and files:

Analysis code
    a. global_variables.py --> Contains several global variables and functions used throughout the other python files
    like the names of the experiments, phenotypic variables and extracting conditional ensembles as explained in the paper.

    b. process_rawdata.py --> Converts the length per time measurements for many experiments into dataframes with
    phenotypic variables per cycle (single-cell).

    c. reorder_wang_files.py --> In our analysis we need each filename to be different. In the data from
    Wang et al 2010, the folder structure is so that there are repeating names. This script copies them into our
    "Datasets" folder and renames them to fit with our processing method by specifying their strain and experiment.


AttractorManifold
    The 3D r=1 attractor figure in inter-division time, growth rate and division ratio axes.


ConditionedVariance
    This folder contains the code used to plot the Conditioned Variance figure in the main text.


ConditionedVarianceSupp
    This folder contains the code used to plot the Conditioned Variance figure in the supplementary text, conditioning
    on experiment as well as microenvironment.


CovarianceDecomposition
    The pyramids that depict the pooled, long and short correlations of main variables in its entries.


Datasets
    This folder contains the raw and processed data from each experiment we looked at.

    a. raw_data_all_in_one.csv --> A dataframe that contains the length per unit-time measurements for all lineages.

    b. RawData --> Contains the length per unit-time measurements for each lineage in a different file.

    c. ProcessedData/physical_units.csv --> Contains the phenotypic variable values of each bacteria measured in
    physical units.

    d. ProcessedData/time_averages.csv --> Contains the (lineage-specific) time averages for all phenotypic variables
    of each bacteria measured.

    e. ProcessedData/trace_centered.csv --> Contains the lineage-centered phenotypic variables values
    of each bacteria measured.

    f. ProcessedData/z_score_under_3/(physical_units/time-averages/trace_centered)_without_outliers.csv --> Contains the
    corresponding dataframe with all lineage-specific outliers of each variable represented as np.nan. An outlier is
    defined as being at least 3 standard deviations away from the mean.


HistogramGenerationsPerLineage
    Plots a histogram depicting the distribution of generations per linege, ie. "lineage length".


IntergenerationalCorrelations
    Creates a dataframe and a figure of pooled correlations of all instances of intergenerationally distant bacteria.


MicroenvironmentAverageBehavior
    The figure in the main text that shows evidence for microenvironmental effects as well as the average behaviors of
    certain phenotypic variables for artificial and trace lineages.


PersistenceMainText
    Create dataframes that contain the DFA analysis as well as their corresponding figures.


PersistenceSupp
    Create the supplementary figure of the scaling coefficient per experiment group.


SizeVariablesAverageBehavior
    Creates the figure of the average behavior of initial size, division size, added length, and fold growth


TablesSupp
    Creates the supplementary tables that contain growth conditions, lineage statistics and coefficients of variation
    for all phenotypic variables.


TimescaleCorrelations
    This folder contains the code used to create the big scatterplot figure of long and short timescale correlations as
    defined in the paper.


TrendForDFA
    Code that creates an figure illustrating the long timescale trend of phenotypic values of a lineage.


PairTimescaleCorrelations
    This folder contains the code used to create the big scatterplot figure of long and short timescale correlations
    between neighbor lineages.



To replicate our results first run process_rawdata.py in the folder Analysis code and then run the rest of the code in
the rest of the folders except for Datasets, which contain the data itself and no code.
